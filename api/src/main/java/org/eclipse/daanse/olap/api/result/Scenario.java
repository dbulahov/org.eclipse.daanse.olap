/**
 * Context for a set of writeback operations.
 *
 * An analyst performing a what-if analysis would first create a scenario, then
 * modify a sequence of cell values.
 *
 * This is an engine concept, not a protocol one: XMLA has no scenario. Where
 * [MS-SSAS] names a handle for pending writeback at all it is the {@code ResultId}
 * of the {@code KeepResult}/{@code Result}/{@code ClearResult} headers, and the
 * specification never ties that handle's lifetime to a session. Who holds a
 * scenario, and for how long, is therefore the caller's decision.
 *
 * Two kinds of pending state live here and they behave differently. The rows
 * added through {@link #addPendingRows} are what a commit writes to a cube's
 * writeback table; they belong to the cube they were produced for, which is why
 * they are kept per cube rather than in one list. The cells recorded by
 * {@link #setCellValue}'s numeric path are in-memory what-if only and are never
 * made permanent - see {@link #getWritebackCells()}.
 *
 * Of jhyde's original description, the identity half is not implemented here: a
 * scenario cannot be named, saved, or reopened.
 *
