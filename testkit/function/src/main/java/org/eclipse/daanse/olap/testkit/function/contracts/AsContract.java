/**
 * The contract of the MDX operator {@code AS} ({@code org.eclipse.daanse.olap.function.def.as},
 * {@code AsAliasFunDef} via {@code AsAliasResolver}) — {@code <Set Expression> AS <Alias>}.
 *
 * <p>{@code AsAliasResolver.resolve} is not a general-purpose resolver: by the time it runs,
 * the parser has already turned the alias identifier into a {@code NamedSetExpression} and
 * cast {@code args[1]} to it unconditionally, with no bounds check on {@code args.length}
 * either. That precondition always holds for real {@code "X as t"} MDX — the parser
 * guarantees it — but this test kit's generic stub-based probing (arity/type sweeps used by
 * promises 3, 4 and 6) cannot supply a real {@code NamedSetExpression} and trips it
 * immediately: an empty probe throws {@code ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException} reading
 * {@code args[0]}, and any two-argument probe throws {@code ClassCastException} casting a
 * stub to {@code NamedSetExpression}. So those promises are waived here, not because the
 * behavior is untested, but because generic type-stub resolution genuinely cannot exercise
 * this atom without crashing — see {@code AsAliasFunDefTest} (mondrian test suite) for
 * real, parser-driven coverage of {@code AS} instead.
